## About VibePick

Musicians can register to the website and have access to the backoffice where they can see messages and reviews from the users, their own statistics and eventually sponsor their own profile so that they can appear on the homepage.</br>

Technologies: **Laravel**, **Vue.js**, **Vue Router**, **Anime.js**.</br>
